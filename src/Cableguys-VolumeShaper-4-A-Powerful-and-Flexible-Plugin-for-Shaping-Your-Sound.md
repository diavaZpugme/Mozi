In this article, we will show you some of the ways you can use VolumeShaper 4 to enhance your music production. We will cover some common scenarios, such as creating sidechain compression, adding movement and groove, and shaping drums and bass. We will also give you some tips and tricks to get the most out of VolumeShaper 4.
 
## Creating Sidechain Compression
 
Sidechain compression is a technique that lowers the volume of one sound when another sound plays. This creates a pumping effect that can make your mix sound more dynamic and energetic. It is often used in electronic music genres, such as house, trance, and EDM, to create space for the kick drum and make the other elements bounce along with it.
 
With VolumeShaper 4, you can create sidechain compression easily and precisely. You can use one of the many presets in the Sidechain category, or you can draw your own curve to match the rhythm and shape of your kick drum. You can also adjust the attack, release, smoothness, and mix parameters to fine-tune the effect.
 
To apply sidechain compression with VolumeShaper 4, you need to insert it on the track or bus that you want to compress. For example, if you want to compress your synth pad, you need to insert VolumeShaper 4 on the synth pad track or bus. Then, you need to select a preset or draw a curve that matches the timing and shape of your kick drum. You can use the oscilloscope and spectrum view to help you align the curve with the kick drum. You can also use the MIDI trigger mode to sync VolumeShaper 4 with your kick drum track.
 
Here is an example of how sidechain compression with VolumeShaper 4 can make your synth pad sound more dynamic and lively:
